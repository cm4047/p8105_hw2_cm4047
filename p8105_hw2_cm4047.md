Define a path to the dataset:

``` r
path_to_data = "./data/Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-8-6-19.xlsx"
```

\#Problem 1

Read the Mr. Trashwheel dataset

``` r
 trashwheel_df = 
        read_xlsx(
                path = path_to_data,
                sheet = "Mr. Trash Wheel",
                range = cell_cols("A:N")) %>%
        janitor::clean_names() %>%
        drop_na(dumpster) %>%
        mutate(
                sports_balls = round(sports_balls),
                sports_balls = as.integer(sports_balls)
        )
```

Read the 2017 precipitation data.

``` r
precip_2017 =
        read_excel(
                path = path_to_data,
                sheet = "2017 Precipitation",
                skip = 1
        ) %>% 
        janitor::clean_names() %>% 
        drop_na(month) %>% 
        mutate(year = 2017) %>%
        relocate(year)
```

Read the 2018 precipitation data.

``` r
precip_2018 =
        read_excel(
                path = path_to_data,
                sheet = "2018 Precipitation",
                skip = 1
        ) %>% 
        janitor::clean_names() %>% 
        drop_na(month) %>% 
        mutate(year = 2018) %>%
        relocate(year)
```

Combine annual precipitation data.

``` r
month_df =
        tibble(
                month= 1:12,
                month_name = month.name
        )
precip_df =
        bind_rows(precip_2017, precip_2018)

precip_df =
        left_join(precip_df, month_df, by = "month") %>% 
        select(-month)
```

This dataset contains information from the Mr. Trashwheel trash
collector in Baltimore, Maryland. As trash enters the inner harbor, the
trashwheel collects that trash, and stores it in a dumpster. The dataset
contains information on year, month, and trash collected, include some
specific kinds of trash. There are a total of 344 rows in our final
dataset. Additional data sheets include month precipitation data.The
dataset contains information on year, total precipitation, and month
names. There are a total of 24 rows in the precipitation dataset. In two
datasets:

  - The median number of sports balls found in a dumpster in 2017 was 8
  - The total precipitation in 2018 was 70.33 inches.

\#Problem 2

Read the NYC transit data.

``` r
nyc_transit_df = 
        read_csv("./data/NYC_Transit_Subway_Entrance_And_Exit_Data.csv") %>%
        janitor::clean_names() %>%
        select(line, station_name, station_latitude, station_longitude, starts_with("route"), entry, vending, entrance_type, ada) %>%
        mutate(entry = recode(entry, "YES" = T, "NO" = F))  
```

    ## Parsed with column specification:
    ## cols(
    ##   .default = col_character(),
    ##   `Station Latitude` = col_double(),
    ##   `Station Longitude` = col_double(),
    ##   Route8 = col_double(),
    ##   Route9 = col_double(),
    ##   Route10 = col_double(),
    ##   Route11 = col_double(),
    ##   ADA = col_logical(),
    ##   `Free Crossover` = col_logical(),
    ##   `Entrance Latitude` = col_double(),
    ##   `Entrance Longitude` = col_double()
    ## )

    ## See spec(...) for full column specifications.

This dataset contains information about entrances and exits for subway
stations in NYC. The dataset contains information on station name, line
name, station location(latitude/longitude), routes served for each
station, and some information about entrance, vending and ADA
compliance.

For my data cleaning steps, first, I use read\_csv function to read the
dataset from the original csv file. Then, I use clean\_names function to
clean all the names in this dataset. Thirdly, I use select to retain all
the columns which I want to be included in the dataset. Finally, I use
mutate function to convert the entry variable from a character variable
to a logical variable.

The dataset contains 1868 rows and 19 columns.

The dataset is not tidy enough. For example, the values for line
variable contain “4 Avenue”, “6 Avenue”, and “42nd St Shuttle”. These
three values are not in the same format. And, there are so many
routes(from “route1” to “route2”), which is so complex. Moreover, some
lines have same values for each variable, which is meaningless.

There are 465 distinct stations.  
There are 84 stations with ADA compliant.  
0.3770492 of station entrances/exits without vending allow entrance.

Reformat data:

``` r
nyc_transit_df = 
        nyc_transit_df %>% 
        mutate(
                route8 = as.character(route8),
                route9 = as.character(route9),
                route10 = as.character(route10),
                route11 = as.character(route11)
        )
nyc_transit_tidy = 
        nyc_transit_df %>% 
        pivot_longer(
                route1:route11,
                values_to = "route_name",
                names_to = "route_number"
) %>%
        separate(route_number, into = c("route", "route_number"), sep = 5) %>% 
        select(-route)
```

There are 60 distinct stations serve the A train. Of the 60 stations
that serve the A train, 17 are ADA compliant.

\#Problem 3

Load and clean data in pols-month.csv:

``` r
month_df = tibble(
                  month = 1:12,
                  month_name = month.name)

    ## Parsed with column specification:

        janitor::clean_names() %>%
        separate(date, into = c("month", "day", "year"), sep = "/") %>% 
        mutate(
                month = as.integer(month)) %>%
        left_join(month_df, by = "month") %>% 
         select(-month, -day) %>% 
         relocate(year, month_name) %>% 
         rename("month" = "month_name") 
```

    ## Parsed with column specification:
    ## cols(
    ##   date = col_character(),
    ##   close = col_double()
    ## )

Load and clean data in unemployment.csv:

``` r
month_name_df = tibble(
        month = str_to_lower(month.abb),
        month_name = month.name
)
unemploy_df = 
        read_csv("./data/fivethirtyeight_datasets/unemployment.csv") %>%
        janitor::clean_names() %>%
        pivot_longer(
                jan:dec,
                values_to = "unemployment_rate",
                names_to = "month"
        ) %>%
        left_join(month_name_df, by = "month") %>% 
        select(-month) %>% 
        rename(month = month_name) %>% 
        relocate(year, month)
```

    ## Parsed with column specification:
    ## cols(
    ##   Year = col_double(),

    ##   Sep = col_double(),
    ##   Oct = col_double(),
    ##   Nov = col_double(),
    ##   Dec = col_double()
    ## )

Then,join all the datasets:

``` r
joint_df = merge(pols_month_df, snp_df) %>% 
        merge(unemploy_df)
```

There are four datasets in total. The first dataset is the
pols\_month\_df dataset, which contains the information on year, month,
type of president, number of republican governors, number of republican
senators, number of republican representatives, number of democratic
governors, number of democratic senators, number of democratic
representatives on the associated date. It have 822 rows and 9 columns
in total. The range of year is ranged from 1947 to 2015. The key
variable is the president variable which indicates the information about
whether the president was republican or democratic on the associated
date.

The second dataset is the snp\_df dataset. It contains the information
on year, month, and the closing values of the S\&P stock index on the
associated date. It have 787 rows and 3 columns in total. The range of
year is ranged from 1950 to 2015. The key variable is the close variable
which shows the closing values of the S\&P stock index on the associated
date.

The third dataset is the unemploy\_df dataset. It contains the
information on year, month, and percentage of unemployment on the
associated date. It have 816 rows and 3 columns in total. The range of
year is ranged from 1948 to 2015. The key variable is the
unemployment\_rate variable which contains the information on the
percentage of unemployment on the associated date.

The last dataset is the joint\_df dataset, which contains the
information on year, month, type of president, number of republican
governors, number of republican senators, number of republican
representatives, number of democratic governors, number of democratic
senators, number of democratic representatives, the closing values of
the S\&P stock index, and percentage of unemployment on the associated
date. It have 786 rows and 11 columns in total. The range of year is
ranged from 1950 to 2015.
